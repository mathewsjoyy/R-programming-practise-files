# You can add a table of contents (TOC) using the toc option and specify the depth of headers that it
#applies to using the toc_depth option. We use 2 as we only have 2 headers
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    theme: united
   #toc_float: true # This will float the TOC on the left so you can always see it

<!-- is used to specify any global settings to be applied to the R Markdown script. The example sets all code chunks as “echo=TRUE”, meaning they will be included in the final rendered version. You can specify other settings in this code chunk, such as the working directory. -->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring:

* HTML
* PDF
* MS Word documents

For more details on using R Markdown see [rmarkdown.rstudio](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- We can add code chunks by clicking the green icon with a c in it, give it a title like 'cars' -->
<!-- Then insert what code you want to show the stakeholders in the back ticks -->
<!-- You can also run the code and check for errors, and select stuff like wether to show these errors, etc. -->
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
